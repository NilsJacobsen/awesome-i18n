## üí≠ Community tips & tricks

- If you have tight layouts, my rough rule of thumb is to double the English text and make sure it fits. Then you will usually have enough space for translations.
- Russian and German tend to have the longest translations, and the longest words. Get familiar with the shy-hyphen `&shy;` character. You put it in the word's html and it will only break the word/show the hyphen when necessary. Google ‚Äúonline hyphenation tool‚Äù so you know the appropriate places to break the word.
- You need to translate numbers with decimals and commas because they are reversed in some languages (period appears as a comma, comma as a period).
- Same goes for percent signs. Sometimes the % shows before the number, and not after. There might be a space between the number and %. It might show as %-KAL in Hungarian.
- Greek question marks look like a semicolon.
- Always keep datetimes in database in UTC. Always return datatimes from backend in UTC. Adjust datetimes on UI layer using timezone information from user or web browser. Accept datetimes in backend with any timezone.
